# React Portfolio Assignment

---

This assignment combines the interpersonal and technical lecture modules by combining the "Tell Your Story" module and the React/Redux module, front-end development, module. This portfolio page will contain their biographies, stories (Maybe in a blog format), resumes, descriptions of the assignments and assessments they completed, any previous projects they built, and professional images of themselves. The students should develop their own user stories and design the portfolio site themselves. Each student will present their portfolio pages along with their stories and experiences through FastTrack'D to the class.

## Goal

---

Students will create their own portfolio page/site and prepare a presentation in which they will cover their experiences at FastTrack'D, their story which they have developed throughout the course, and their technical abilities by using their portfolio sites to effectively guide and support their presentation. This will serve as a great resource for representing each student individually and their experience throughout the lecture modules of FastTrack'D.
