          <p>My name is Winston Pidor. I was born and raised in the southern part of the Philippines. In the last 3 years of my high school, I moved to my grandfather in the province and continued my high school. This is where I first learned computers. GWbasic was our programming language.</p>
          <p>Playing darts is my favorite pastime. Everyday after school and or during Saturdays and sundays, I worked in my grandfather's wholesale retail store. After work, before the sun goes down, I rush home and ride my uncleâ€™s racer bike.</p>
          <p>After I graduated highschool, I then moved back to my parents in the city for college and graduated Computer Engineering.</p>

          <p>On August 2000, I worked in CDR. A dutch company. We were trained as a java swing developer and developed standalone applications which later migrated to servlets and applets. I was deployed and selected as team lead to Dole company and developed web application using struts 1, javascript and html for their HR department. </p>
          <p>I went to several companies after CDR. I first learned spring framework in Innovagency(May 2005), a swiss company. Then on May 2009, I went to St Lukes Medial Center, I worked as senior programmer. We developed hospital systems using spring and hibernate.</p>
          <p>On November 2010, I moved to Verifone, a USA company. I spent most of my developer years. They were using Broadvision that uses struts 1 and Spring framework. This is where I learned to integrate different systems using BPEL, SOAP and Spring rest. </p>
