React Assignment - Porting Dev Duel
===================================

For this assignment, students will take their completed Dev Duel assignment and create a React frontend for it. Utilizing the server from their previous project, students shall recreate the client from scratch as a single-page application (SPA) with React.

After performing the initial setup, students should carefully reimplement their client according to the requirements.

Upon completion, the new React frontend should be both visually and behaviorally identical to their original.

## Initial Setup

---

The root directory of this assignment is essentially a container. **After following these steps:**

1. Copy the Dev Duel assignment into the **/server** directory
2. Within this directory, run `create-react-app` to create a basic React project within an aptly named folder, such as: **/client** or **/frontend**
3. Install any necessary dependencies for your React project, such as `react-router-dom` & `styled-components`

**... you will have two JavaScript packages.** The first will be the copied Dev Duel, and the second will be the just-created React app.

##### That means you'll have two instances of node running while you're developing!

## Requirements

---

 - [ ] Utilize React Routing to recreate the Home, Inspect, and Duel pages
 - [ ] Break down the HTML & CSS of the last assignment into re-usable, composable components
 - [ ] Properly utilize state & props with your components to maintain a clean architecture
