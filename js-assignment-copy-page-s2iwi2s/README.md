# js-assignment-copy-page

In this assignment, students are tasked with copying the Mac tech specs website saved in the MacBook Pro - Technical Specifications - Apple.pdf in HTML and CSS. This will give them practice with layouts in CSS and allow them to play around with the tags available in HTML5. Students should try to make their copy of the page as accurate as possible without literally copying any code from the site.

The rubric provided with the assignments details the minimum work required for the student to earn full credit. However, this should not discourage students who want to to recreate the entire page. Just remember the MVP is completing the sections required by the rubric. Anything beyond that is great practice, but is not required for grading.
